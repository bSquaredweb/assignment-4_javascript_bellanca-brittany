## Resources

- [W3Schools Array Push](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_push.asp): I used this site to help me understand how to add another item to an array.
- [Wikipedia Presidents Information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Presidents_of_the_United_States): I used this site to help find the information for the President objects.
- [W3Schools Conditional Statements](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_if_else.asp): I used this site to help me understand how to write conditionals that were more than just an if...else statement.

## Deductions

> I reviewed the list of deductions for this project and in the syllabus.

## Comments
- I feel like we were missing a video from Richard? Like when this week's video started, he had code on his screen about arrays and objects that we had not watched.
- I struggled with the final part of step 6 (Function with Parameter) and would have liked some sort of direct instruction on this topic. I could not find this in Richard's videos that were shared with us.
